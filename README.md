# Decision-Support-System-Laboratory <br>
Decision Support System Laboratory exam group project<br>
We accessed data of different formats (CSV, XML, JSON), preprocessed it, and populated a database using SQL Server Management Studio. <br>
Next, we extracted knowledge from the data via standard SSIS nodes, MDX queries on our OLAP cube, and via Power BI we created plots/dashboards. <br>
In the repository there are:<br>
-The Codes folder with all the codes divided in 3 folders;<br>
-The Report folder with the pdf of all the processes explained.
