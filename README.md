# Decision-Support-System-Laboratory
Repository for the Decision Support System Laboratory exam group project.

We accessed data of different formats (CSV, XML, JSON), preprocessed it, and populated a database using SQL Server Management Studio.
Next, we extracted knowledge from the data via standard SSIS nodes, MDX queries on our OLAP cube, and via Power BI we created plots/dashboards.
In the repository there are:
-The Codes folder with all the codes divided in 3 folders;
-The Report folder with the pdf of all the processes explained.
